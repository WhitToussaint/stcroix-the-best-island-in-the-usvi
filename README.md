# stcroix-the-best-island-in-the-usvi
 My father is from the beautiful, but often overlooked island of St. Croix. My twin sister and I spent most of our childhood there visiting our father and his family. In fact, our family can trace their roots on the island back to the 1800s. St. Croix is such a beautiful island that is also a US Territory. I'm hopeful that this little map and video can let people know more about this beautiful island that you don't need a passport to get to.
